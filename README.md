# TVScraper
Get real-time indicator data from TradingView

- Only login via Email supported.
- Shows the last watched trading pair
- Prints a csv string to TradingViewScraper/IndicatorData/indicatorData.txt with all indicator values. (You need to detect them by hand)
- Note that TV has a slight delay maybe depending on your plan

It's enough for me for right now to play with. Probably will add switching to other tradingpairs, multiple charts etc. as time goes by.
